# Abbreviation Folder

## 1. Overview

This folder contains two files:

- **Standard Abbreviation**:  
  This file is based on The Leipzig Glossing Rules: Conventions for interlinear morpheme-by-morpheme glosses, providing a list of standardized abbreviations. The source of this data is the official document, which can be accessed at the following link: [Leipzig Glossing Rules PDF](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/Glossing-Rules.pdf).

- **Austronesian_Abbreviation**:  
  This file contains abbreviations commonly used in Austronesian linguistics, provided by the center's staff based on actual needs.

## 2. Usage Instructions

When using the Universal Template's `Interlinear gloss: Mandarin` field, please refer to the abbreviations and their translations found in these two files. The Chinese translations in the files were edited by the center's staff. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to provide feedback.

## 3. Annotation Guidelines

To save space, when using the `Interlinear gloss: Mandarin` field, you can directly use the Leipzig glossing rules system for person and number markings, without translating them into Chinese. For example, the Chinese pronoun "ä»–" can be annotated as `3SG`, without the need to further label it as "third person singular".
